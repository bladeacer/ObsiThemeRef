### About the old scoring system
Henceforth, the scoring system will be delegated as second class. It shall be changed merely to serve as a reference, which is what this site should be.

## About the reference criteria
Each of the themes will be evaluated on the following criteria, serving as information users would be interested in:

- Dark/Light mode support
    - Whether there is a supported colour scheme provided by the theme for light/dark mode or both

- One or multiple colour schemes
    - Whether the theme bundles one colour scheme for light/dark mode, both light and dark more, or multiple colour schemes for light and dark mode

- Value propositions 
    - What the theme does different from others

- Accessibility
    - Was the theme built with accessibility in mind? Are there any options to configure stuff like contrast and font size?

- Style Settings support
    - Does the theme add customisation options via Style Settings?

- Age of the theme 
    - Older themes are expected to be more mature and stable

- Last Updated
    - Is this theme actively maintained? When was it last updated?
