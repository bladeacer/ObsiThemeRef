## Excerpt from README
Arcane, a lightweight and mobile-friendly refresh of my legacy Obsidian theme Dracula \+ LYT

## Features
“The Arcane theme was initially designed as a base16 theme, utilizing a 16-color palette composed of 8 shades and 8 accents. The beauty of this approach is its flexibility and simplicity. Want a new theme every week or month? Simply replace the main 8 color variables in the .css file. Whether you're aiming for the aesthetics of DOOM EMACS, DARK ONE, ATOM, or NORD, all it takes is a change of 8 colors. No more fiddling with complex color schemes\!

However, everything changed when I came across `#88c0d4`, a soft, muted cyan that I absolutely adore. Every time I open my vault, this color palette evokes feelings of clarity, calmness, and freshness. It is the color which had to stay and the rest of the accents simply followed.

This Theme doesn't rely on 16 colors anymore. But the idea of the `base16` framework is still there.”
