## Excerpt from README
Abyssal is a simple theme from a typing enthusiast who was looking for modifications that would improve the reading and writing experience without dramatically changing Obsidian’s interface.

Inspired by the depths of the ocean, it’s a theme that focuses on white space and mute colors (respecting accessibility standards). Your accent color will influence the theme but not in an expressive way (it’s too dark where the abyssal fish live 🐟).

## Features
There are many small details handled in Abyssal, but the most notable are:

- Asymmetrical spacing for more breathing room of the vertical rhythm (based on an 8px grid)  
- Bespoke line-height treatment for each heading type  
- Higher contrast through type size, weight, and spacing  
- Contextual spacing based on the display or omission of some items (e.g., Inline title)

Special attention was given to the styling of:

- Highlights  
- List spacing  
- Tables  
- Front-matter display \+ inline title
