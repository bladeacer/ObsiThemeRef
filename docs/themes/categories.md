This page contains information about Obsidian themes, and what they specifically excel at. This is due to the fact that themes are subjective in nature. 

### About the old scoring system
There will be no more ranking or scoring, as all themes take extensive **time and effort** put in by the theme developer. The category entries will be in alphabetical order. Tag descriptions will be apt for describing a theme in its entirety, so that the evaluation of which theme to try is down to the user.

# Themes by category
There can be at most three themes per letter, per category. Themes cannot appear in multiple categories.
