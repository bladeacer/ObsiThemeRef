This page contains information about Obsidian themes, and what they specifically
excel at. This is due to the fact that themes are subjective in nature.

# Themes by category

There can be at most three themes per letter, per category.
Themes cannot appear in multiple categories.

### Sorting

By default, the themes are sorted in alphabetical order.
However, you can change their order by clicking on the table headers.

### About the old scoring system

There will be no more ranking or scoring, as all themes take extensive
**time and effort** put in by the theme developer. The category entries will be
in alphabetical order. Tag descriptions will be apt for describing a theme, so
that the evaluation of which theme to try is down to the user.
